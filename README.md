# hard scrapes
Maybe a repo of code/tales of really annoying and painful web scraping jobs done in the name of journalism? Public/gov sites only. A collection of useful tips as well as bitter complaints.

Just listing some stuff for now, unstructured:


- https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s; FBI Crime in the U.S. data/info; multiple report formats/structures over the years, with different file formats (xls, pdf, zipped archives)
- https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/home/; Senate disclsoures; cookie/state-based navigation, data in HTML and PDF, inconsistent naming
- http://exthcpui.pfizer.com:84/HCPDisclosureWebApplication/jsp/payments_report.jsp; Pfizer payments to doctors, so, so unnecessarily complicated, so so many pages
- https://services.sccgov.org/facilityinspection;Santa Clara county food facility inspection report; please don't make gov sites rely on AJAX
